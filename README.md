# Data-Structure-Algo
A place to store my Data Structure &amp; Algorithm homework.

Except for HW5, all the other HWs are about to build data structure from scratch.

HW1: CSE Review
   
* Array Problems:

    * toString(): Converting the array to string representation.
    * reverse(): Reversing the array element.
    * rotateRight(): Shifting one element right for 1 times.
* Map Problems:
    
    *  contains3(): return true if any string occurs at least 3 times in the input list.
    *  intersect(): Using two maps as input, return the elements that exist in both maps.
* Linkedlist Problems:

    * reverse3(): Reversing the linkedlist.
    * firstToLast(): Making the first list node to the end.
    * concatenate(): Combining two linked list.
* Tree Problems:

    * depthSum(): Computing the sum of depth times value.
    * removeLeaves(): Removing the buttom of the tree.
    * trim(): Trimming the tree for a specific ranging.
